## Tableau Desktop: Working with Cube Data Sources
### Instructions for Using Parameters to Filter a Dashboard in Tableau with Cube Data Sources
Due to cube limitation of using parameters as filter.

** Step 1: Create a Parameter **
Go to Data > Create Parameter.
Name it Sheet Selector.
Set the data type to String.
Add the values: sheet 1, sheet 2, and all.
Step 2: Create a Calculated Field
Go to Analysis > Create Calculated Field.
Name it Sheet Filter.
Use the following formula:
SQL

IF [Sheet Selector] = 'sheet 1' THEN 1
ELSEIF [Sheet Selector] = 'sheet 2' THEN 2
ELSEIF [Sheet Selector] = 'all' THEN 3
END
Description: This calculated field converts the string values from the parameter into integers, which can be used for filtering.
**Step 3: Apply the Calculated Field as a Filter **
Go to each sheet you want to swap.
Drag the Sheet Filter calculated field to the Filters shelf.
Set the filter to match the corresponding integer value.
For sheet 1, set the filter to 1.
For sheet 2, set the filter to 2.
For all, set the filter to 3.
Step 4: Add the Parameter Control to the Dashboard
Drag the Sheet Selector parameter to the dashboard to allow users to select which sheet to display.
Description: This parameter control will enable users to switch between different sheets based on their selection.
Comments
Using Parameters: Parameters in Tableau are versatile and can be used to control various aspects of your dashboard, including filtering, calculations, and sheet swapping.
Cube Data Sources: When working with cube data sources, certain functions and features may be limited. Using parameters and calculated fields creatively can help overcome these limitations.
